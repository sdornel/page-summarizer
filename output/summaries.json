Cat history, it is generally believed, can be traced back to the ‘Miacis’ (pronounced: mi-a-sis), a weasel like creature that inhabited the earth some 40 or so million years ago. By the close of the Stone Age cats had learned that where humans were found, there was the easy prey of rodents, this was still too early in cat history for them to be considered domestic pets. Some superstitions last to this very day, with some animal shelters refusing to allow the adoption of black cats near Halloween for fear of some ritual being the final destination for the poor cat."

The following are some of the main stages of cat evolution: The Miocene epoch (23-5.3 million years ago) saw the emergence of more advanced feline genera, such as Smilodon, Homotherium, and Nimravides. For example, a cat may rub its head against another cat as a sign of affection, or flatten its ears and arch its back to show aggression or fear. For example, bobcats and lynx may wait patiently near water sources for prey to approach, while jaguars and leopards may use stealth and surprise to ambush prey from trees or bushes. Similarly, the eradication of rats and mice in urban areas provided a new habitat for domestic cats, leading to the evolution of city-dwelling felines with unique behaviors and physical traits."

From their early days as wild hunters to their current status as beloved pets, cats have played an important role in human history and continue to be cherished by millions around the world. The wild cats that were hunting these rodents soon found that they could live quite comfortably amongst humans in exchange for keeping the rodent population under control. From the small, arboreal creatures of the Late Miocene era to the majestic, powerful big cats of today, these animals have adapted and thrived in a wide variety of environments. This led to a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and cats, with cats helping to control the rodent population and humans providing cats with a steady source of food and protection."

Researchers also studied the DNA of many domestic cats too (including purebreds) and their DNA is almost identical to that of Felis sylvestris lybica , which tells us that despite there being five groups of wildcats in the world, all domestic cats originated from only one group, Felis sylvestris lybica. From these humble beginnings, the cat fancy was born, and from there, cats went from ‘mousers’ to pampered household pets and an interest in developing breeds which arose from the already naturally occurring breeds, crossbreeding to create new breeds, spontaneous mutations and finally hybrid cats. I can’t give you a definitive answer as to why this came about, but we can speculate that members of the public, as well as the cat fancy, wanted to preserve the integrity, beauty, and uniqueness of each breed. Domestic cats spread across the globe along well-established trade routes of merchants forming distinct landraces (a locally adapted species of animal who has adapted to its environment over time)."

The historical reliance on cats for pest control underscores their enduring relationship with humans, marking them as not only cherished companions but also essential contributors to the well-being of ancient societies. Their natural inclination to stalk and pounce made them indispensable assets in preserving food supplies, preventing the spread of diseases carried by pests, and safeguarding valuable commodities.

Indeed, they exude a natural majesty, a feature that has earned them the affectionate moniker of “gentle giants.” Their lustrous, flowing coats and characteristic tufted ears augment this impression of grandness and confer upon the breed an almost regal bearing. Looking forward, the stewardship of the Maine Coon’s legacy remains a collaborative effort amongst responsible breeders, dedicated clubs, and loving guardians, ensuring that the storied history and purring presence of the Maine Coon will delight and thrive for generations to come.. The breed’s morphological characteristics—its substantial bone structure, tufted ears, and shaggy coat—are hypothesized to result from the intermingling of short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds, possibly introduced by seafaring Europeans. Through seminars, publications, and online platforms, breed enthusiasts disseminate knowledge on proper care, dietary requirements, and behavioral management, crucial for owners to foster an environment conducive to the breed’s physical and psychological health."

Unlike other domesticated animals, which have been bred for different physical traits to help with tasks, such as food, hunting, or security, modern cat breeds originated mostly within the last 150 years from breeding for physical traits with no differentiation in functionality—just aesthetic differences. [ 13 ] Scientists and veterinarians specifically have incorporated an important tool known as race and breed identification panels to learn more about the specific genetics that align with these dominating regions domesticated cat breeds originate from. [ 2 ] In 2007, archaeologists working in Cyprus found an even older burial ground, a Neolithic site that is approximately 9,500 years old, of a 30-year-old man buried with a cat. Unlike most pet dogs, which come from a mixture of purebreed lineages, cats started as a mixture of many wildcat variations and have been selectively bred by humans for certain traits that lead to modern breeds."

It took approximately 20 seconds to acquire a single image slice, making full-body scans feasible, although patients still had to hold their breath during this process – a key distinction from the EMI scanner, which could not perform body scans due to its five-minute acquisition time for a single slice. [ 29 ] The first production X-ray CT machine (in fact called the \"EMI-Scanner\") was limited to making tomographic sections of the brain, but acquired the image data in about 4 minutes (scanning two adjacent slices), and the computation time (using a Data General Nova minicomputer) was about 7 minutes per picture. [ 20 ] In 1959, UCLA neurologist William Oldendorf conceived an idea for \"scanning a head through a transmitted beam of X-rays, and being able to reconstruct the radiodensity patterns of a plane through the head\" after watching an automated apparatus built to reject frostbitten fruit by detecting dehydrated portions. CT may use continuous rotation of the gantry, and can acquire a data set in a few seconds with a spiral technique where the patient is moved in continuously while the machine basically acquires a single spiraling slice, so that all areas of interest are covered quickly."

Though these features may be \"cuter\", they result in many health issues including ill-functioning nasolacrimal systems where tears build and flow down the face, a soft and long palate that obstructs the upper airway making breathing more difficult, and dental and jaw defects ( brachygnathia ) where the teeth grow outwardly in unnatural positions, making it difficult to eat and increasing the chance of plaque formation gingivitis. Such health issues affect the quality of life of many Persian cats, especially those that fall into the severe category, and raise questions about the ethics and legality of these deformity breeding programmes.As a consequence of the BBC programme Pedigree Dogs Exposed , cat breeders have also come under pressure from veterinary and animal welfare associations, with the Persian singled out as one of the breeds most affected by health problems. The Cabulees call this cat bubuk [buruk?] or boorrak, and they encourage the growth of his long hair by washing it with soap and combing it.” [ 15 ] Seeing as the British seemed to assume the majority of Persian cats stemmed from Afghanistan , there is reason to infer that no small portion of the original Persian cat breed stock was, among other places, imported from Afghanistan to Britain and other European countries."

Still, a few breeders, particularly in the UK, continued to breed and register them, resulting in today's two types of Siamese: the modern, \"show-style\", standardised Siamese, and the \"Traditional Siamese\", both descended from the same distant ancestors, but with few or no recent ancestors in common, and effectively forming distinct sub-breeds, with some pressure to separate them. Eventually, the modern show Siamese was bred to be extremely elongated, with a lean, tubular body, long, slender legs, a very long, very thin tail that tapers gradually into a point, and a long, wedge-shaped head topped by extremely large, wide-set ears.

In 2010, DNA analysis confirmed that Sphynx hairlessness was produced by a different allele of the same gene that produces the short curly hair of the Devon Rex (termed the \"re\" allele), with the Sphynx's allele being incompletely dominant over the Devon allele and both being recessive to the wild type. [ 7 ] The Tenhoves were initially able to obtain for the new breed provisional showing status through the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) but ultimately had the status revoked in 1971, when it was felt by the CFA Board that the breed had concerns over fertility.

This same principle exists today in businesses that have a symbiotic relationship with felines, such as in New York City, where food market owners gladly pay the $200-$350 fine from the health department to keep cats around and the mice away. It’s been difficult for researchers to pin down the exact origin of the house cat, but it’s believed our furry friends evolved from wildcats roughly 12,000 years ago , around the time that humans moved to an agricultural lifestyle. Today’s kitties tend to be smaller , due to a change in diet and activity level, and their coats have become more colorful as they have less of an evolutionary need to blend in with their surroundings.

(Oddly, domestic cats seem to have reached the British Isles before the Romans brought them over—a dispersal that researchers cannot yet explain.) Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the globe, domestic cats had presumably spread to the Orient almost 2,000 years ago, along well-established trade routes between Greece and Rome and the Far East, reaching China by way of Mesopotamia and arriving in India via land and sea. The putative antiquity of these breeds received support from the results of genetic studies announced in 2008, in which Marilyn Menotti-Raymond of the National Cancer Institute and Leslie Lyons of the University of California, Davis, found DNA differences between today’s European and Oriental domestic cat breeds indicative of more than 700 years of independent cat breeding in Asia and Europe. In the genetic analysis, published in 2007, Driscoll, another of us (O’Brien) and their colleagues focused on two kinds of DNA that molecular biologists traditionally examine to differentiate subgroups of mammal species: DNA from mitochondria, which is inherited exclusively from the mother, and short, repetitive sequences of nuclear DNA known as microsatellites. Confounding the issue was the fact that members of these wildcat groups are hard to tell apart from one another and from feral domesticated cats with so-called mackerel- tabby coats because all of them have the same pelage pattern of curved stripes and they interbreed freely with one another, further blurring population boundaries."

This may have been his first introduction to human anatomy as an example of the problem of “reading through a box.” He pondered whether a system could theoretically recognize text in a closed book, page by page, “by shining a bright light across each page from various angles and measure what came out the other end.” He had simplified the volumetric “book-box” problem to a two-dimensional problem by breaking it down into a series of parallel slices. Joseph Califano, the US Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare stated in 1977 before a Senate subcommittee, “We do not need a CT scanner in every hospital in this country….Every child does not need a Rolls Royce; every teenager does not need a Cadillac; every hospital does not need a CT scanner.” Fortunately, many others, including medical professionals, who had seen the impact CT could have in patient care disagreed with Mr. Credit for building the first body scanner is often given to Robert Ledley, a Georgetown University dentist who, after traveling to the UK to look into buying an EMI scanner, returned to Georgetown and founded DISCO (Digital Information Science Corporation) to develop a first-generation body system (essentially a scaled version of the EMI-scanner) with a 5-min scan time, which was installed at Georgetown in 1974. While that request was rejected, he received advice for improvements and in October he submitted a funding application entitled “Proposed Project: An Improved Form of X-Radiography.” 13 Its purpose was “to investigate the employment of a computer to make better use of the information when an object is examined by gamma rays or x-rays.” 20 , 22 The proposal, portions of which are shown in Fig."

Along this line, Ann was granted a patent by the United States Patent Office on December 19, 1975, (Patent 1026916) and registered with the state of California (#53044) April 16, 1975. Ann believed that better litters were achieved when employing the light side/dark side theory, and she indicated that Fugianna was the light side and Buckwheat was the dark side. Over the years, the offspring of Ann’s breedings would become known for good temperament, large size, non-matting coat and striking appearance.

While the breed crossings began more than 120 years ago, the actual Bengal species wasn’t established until the 1970s when Jean Sugden Mill bred the Asian leopard cat hybrids with domestic cat breeds. However, it’s important to feed your Bengal high-quality cat food with minimally processed ingredients to make sure they stick to a healthy diet that stays true to their obligate carnivore needs. Bengal cats are generally healthy , but there are a few notable diseases that have been seen throughout the breed: Since they are long and muscular, Bengals can appear to be larger than their actual weight suggests. They can have spotted or marbled coat patterns in standard colors like brown, snow and silver, as well as non-standard colors like charcoal, blue and melanistic (solid black)."

Cats evolved from wild felines in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago, forming bonds with humans by hunting mice attracted to stored grain. These genes are part of what makes cats so good at catching prey and why they’ve been such successful pets for thousands of years.

(Numbers are fuzzy, but the global population of cats and dogs approaches a billion for each.) Clearly, the few evolutionary changes the domestic cat has made have been the right ones to wangle their way into people’s hearts and homes. In theory, any of these species could have been the progenitor of the domestic cat, but recent DNA studies demonstrate unequivocally that today’s housecats arose from the African wildcat – specifically, the North African subspecies, Felis silvestris lybica. Scientists suggest that these shorter, higher-pitched sounds are more pleasing to our auditory system , perhaps because young humans have high-pitched voices, and domestic cats have evolved accordingly to curry human favor. Scientists digitally compared the spectral qualities of the two types of purrs and discovered that the major difference is that the insistent purr includes a component very similar to the sound of a human baby crying."

Understanding the domestication journey of cats sheds light on how they became one of our most beloved pets. The first signs of cat domestication date back to around 9,500 years ago in the Near East. Archaeological findings suggest that humans and cats initially connected over a shared interest in agriculture and pest control. Today, cats are celebrated members of households worldwide, known for their unique personalities and close companionship with humans."

The Felis Catus represented two gods: God Osiris who, when he did not want to be recognised, liked to transform into a cat, and the Goddess Bastet , or Bast, benefactress with the body of a woman and the head of a cat. But the real \"century of the cat\" was the nineteenth century; the romantic writers saw in this animal their symbol and became its most passionate defenders , in this way also influencing the feelings of the population who, finally, abandoned their last prejudices. At the start of the Renaissance, the cat was poorly represented in religious paintings, as it still dragged its grim medieval reputation as a close collaborator of the Evil One, and an essentially symbolic art could not but steer clear of all this."

They both enjoy 16-20 hours of sleep each day, a great sense of smell, are carnivores, spend 30 to 50% of their waking hours grooming, do a lot of stalking, love playing (read: laser pointers, hopping into boxes, wand toys, etc.) and catnip, are territorial and vocal, play with and save food, and like kneading. Additional kitty attributes are their abrasive tongue–the perfect grooming tool, their thick paw pads that help provide smooth landings when jumping, they have tree-climbing claws, their fur regulates body temperature, and they can jump six times their height. Researchers found paintings from the golden age of ancient Egypt, around 3,600 years ago, of kitties eating from bowls, laying under chairs, snacking on scrap food, and sometimes wearing a cat collar or leash–indicating that kitties were members of the human family. Researcher Carlos Driscoll told the Washington Post that they domesticated themselves to some extent because they noticed that rodents flocked to human stores of grain and knew they could feast on mice by staying near human agriculture spots."

The present version represents a marked improvement over previous cat linkage maps as it (i) nearly doubles the number of markers that were present in the second-generation linkage map in the cat, (ii) provides a linkage map generated in a domestic cat pedigree which will more accurately reflect recombination distances than previous maps generated in a hybrid pedigree, and (iii) provides single linkage groups spanning each autosome. Additionally, a post-assignment verification step with the five phenotypic single nucleotide polymorphisms accurately identified between 0.31 and 0.58 of the misassigned individuals raising the sensitivity of assignment with the frequentist method to 0.89 and 0.92 for single nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats respectively. Russian Journal of Genetics: Applied Research, 2012 The genetic structure of Felis catus domestic cat populations was analyzed for the European con tinent, United States, and Canada, and it was established that the analyzed populations are divided into two clusters (groups), i.e., Western European-Northern Amercan and Eastern European. Eighty-one type I markers were integrated with 247 type II markers from a first-generation map to generate a map of 328 loci (320 autosomal and 8 X-linked) distributed in 47 linkage groups, with an average intermarker spacing of 8 cM."

Through our fearless advocacy, humane care, education and outreach, and law and policy activism, we equip and mobilize citizens, advocates, grassroots groups, shelters, veterinary professionals, and elected officials across the United States and around the world to improve their communities for cats through nonlethal, evidence-based approaches. 2 Especially prized as mousers on ships, cats traveled with people around the globe: Throughout all this time, cats were allowed to come and go freely from human householdseven President Calvin Coolidge’s cat had free rein to wander to and from the White House during the 1920s. Pans filled with dirt or newspaper were used indoors by a few cat owners, but it wasn’t until the first clay litter was accidentally discovered in 1947 and the subsequent marketing of the Tidy Cats® brand in the 1960s that litter boxes really caught on. Taking advantage of this new, abundant food source, Middle Eastern wildcats, or felix silvestris lybica , preyed on the rodents and decided to stick around these early towns, scavenging the garbage that all human societies inevitably producejust as community cats do today."

The first is that cat domestication was a “complex, long-term process featuring extensive translocations that allowed admixture of events between geographically separated cat populations at different points in time”. The research provided DNA evidence found in the teeth, skin, nails and hair of various domestic cats and compared it with different archaeological sites from Africa, Asia and Europe [2]. Even today there is still much debate over whether the domestic cat should be classified and an independent species or continue as a subspecies of the Eurasian wildcat ( Felis silvestris ). It has been assumed that the first species related to felids would have been Proailurus , a small tree-dwelling carnivorous animal which inhabited Europe about 40 million years ago."

The researchers speculate, “Recent data indicate a significant overlap in the appearance of house mice ( Mus musculus ) and cats in Late Neolithic Eastern Europe, and suggest that the house mouse was an important factor for the dispersal of cats within Europe.” An enmity for the ages, in other words. Because the five known varieties of wildcat (Near Eastern, Chinese, Central Asian, Southern African, and European) are quite similar and can interbreed, scientists until recently had a hard time pinning down in which part of the world cat domestication first occurred. ( You try to make a cat do anything.) The oldest archaeological evidence for cat domestication is a 9,500-year-old grave, discovered in Cyprus in 2004, in which a Paleolithic-era human was buried with their feline pet. Because they weren’t bred for any other purpose, these cats looked similar to the various kinds of wildcats that existed (and still do), except that they’re less solitary and more tolerant of people (and other cats)."

Second, the role of pets in the home has changed, presenting a hugely profitable market for companies that cater to “pet parents” and people who call their animals their “fur babies.” How we treat our companion animals has evolved into a closer, more intimate relationship, demanding a rethink of those roles; the cat lady’s outsize affection for her cats is no longer unusual, much less socially unacceptable. But neither was it entirely wrong: Research conducted by Tufts University’s Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium between 1996 and 2006 found evidence that some hoarders fit the “crazy cat lady” stereotype: “a single, older woman, living alone and socioeconomically disadvantaged.” The crazy cat lady stereotype reached a visibility high point in the 1990s, with the character Eleanor Abernathy, MD, JD, from “The Simpsons,” who throws cats and raves incoherently. You own cats.” A 2014 paper on the enduring anxiety around the “old maid” in Israeli culture noted, “The unmarried woman is regularly stereotyped as lonely, miserable, and with no alternative but to fill her empty life with cats.” The global subtext — you can have cats or you can have a husband, but you can’t have both. Miss Havisham may not have owned cats, but the degraded, deranged figure who tortures Pip in “Great Expectations” was likely inspired by a real-life woman who did — a London spinster who became a shut-in and wore only white after her rejected suitor shot himself in the head in front of her."

As anyone familiar with cats can tell you, the scenario of humans somehow forcing cats to perform this service is unlikely—cats likely began this behavior on their own. The characteristics of the cat—a relatively asocial nature, territoriality, a requirement for a meat-based diet, and a lack of usefulness to humans—suggest that domestication was the cats’ idea. Researchers into cat evolution speculate that it began when African Wildcats (which, despite their name, were present in the Near East) began to live near human settlements. Domestication was shown to have taken place not in Egypt, but in the Near East, most likely in the Fertile Crescent at the same time as the development of agriculture."

Hersey criticized the current readers as containing “insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children” and said that the stories and art are “uniform, bland, idealized and terribly literal.” In response, William Spaulding, then a director at Houghton Mifflin, provided Geisel with a vocabulary list for six- and seven-year-olds to see if he could answer Hersey’s call. Though The Cat in the Hat is among his most well-known works, Geisel described it as “painful to write when you can’t use any adjectives and few nouns.” The book was an enduring critical and commercial success—at its 60-year anniversary in 2017, Random House had sold more than 16 million copies of the book.

When Hsinbyushin, the King of Burma, found and read the Tamra Maew, he took to heart the passages that described the Siamese cats as being “more valuable than gold” and stated that “those who owned one would be wealthy.” As a result, he ordered his men to bring back Suphalak cats with the other treasures of Siam. They feature a pointed coat pattern, meaning they have a light-colored body with darker extremities (ears, tail, paws, and face.) However, all Siamese cats are born with white fur; the colored points develop when the cats are a few weeks old.

Other breeds that originated from the Middle East and Asia, such as the Japanese Bobtail, Siamese, and Siberian Cat, suggest that Asian societies were likely specifically breeding certain types of cats for either domestic use such as hunting rodents, kept as household pets, or used as both. While they have been pets since likely the Neolithic period more than 9,0000 years ago, it was only since the Renaissance that people began to more commonly have cats in their homes or at least incorporate them in their daily activities through paintings and other depictions. [2] While the transition of wild cats to domesticated or at least semi-domesticated cats appears to be relatively clear, particularly as agriculture became prominent around the world, what is less clear is how cats became true pets. However, from tomb paintings, it is also clear that the Egyptians had an affinity and care for the cats, suggesting that cats by then were now more intertwined with daily life and people actively took care of cats."

In a pair of preprint studies posted in March 2025 to bioRxiv , European researchers recently revisited this question — and introduced a gruesome theory: maybe cats were first tamed not to be pets, but to be sacrificed. What’s clear is that once domesticated, cats spread quickly — likely aided by Roman expansion — and now enjoy global popularity, with nearly a billion living among us. To explore that possibility, one study led by Sean Doherty from the University of Exeter compared bone measurements of the Cyprus cat with bones from known wild and domestic cats across Europe."

Apparently, whether a black cat is viewed as a benevolent creature or an evil supernatural force is entirely based on whichever lore one is likely to embrace.” From the Lost Ark to the quest for the Holy Grail, explore videos about ancient mysteries. “Witches do tend towards the practical.” Eventually, the fear surrounding black cats and their association with witchcraft made its way across the Atlantic, courtesy of Puritan colonists , says Daniel Compora, associate professor of English language and literature at The University of Toledo.

One of the eyes of the cat is embellished with gold leaf gilding, which, according to the British Museum , is “the only known example of gilding on wall paintings in Theban tomb chapels.” The presence of cats in tombs wasn’t limited to paintings—sometimes cats were mummified and placed inside their human companion’s tomb, according to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. So, to see cats included in these tableaus speaks to their importance both in the daily lives of ancient Egyptians and in their hope that they continued with them into the Hereafter.” On walls from the Tomb of Nebamun, now housed at the British Museum , one painting features a cat accompanying Nebamun while he is out fishing and fowling.

Domestic cats fall into the ‘Felidae’ family, which can be split into three genera: Panthera (lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars etc.) Felis (‘small’ cats) Felis catus is the most recently evolved species within the Felidae family. Domestic cats fall into the ‘Felidae’ family Cats and humans have co-existed as far back as 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, located in the Middle East Unlike dogs, most cats aren’t really ‘domesticated’. Since being worshipped in Egypt around 3,600 years ago, domestic cats (also known as Felis catus ) are common household ‘fur-riends’ that have found a mutual love for humans. Unlike other domesticated creatures, cats have historically contributed little to human survival, so scientists and researchers have often wondered how and why cats came to live amongst people."

During this decade these same farmers began having their own cat show at the Skowhegan Fair where Maine Coon Cats from all over the territory competed for the title “Maine State Champion Coon Cat.”” “As early as 1861 my younger brother and myself owned jointly a beautiful long-haired black, pointed with white; he bore for several years under the remarkable name of “Captain Jenks of the House Marines.” I have no recollection of his earlier history or advent.

A dozen of these very first Maine Coon Cats were listed in a program of a show held in Boston in January 1878.¹ And, in another more famous show held in NYC’s Madison Square Garden in 1895, a brown tabby female Maine Coon named “Cosie” took home the win and also special for best cat in the show.² Image source: © Simpson, Frances (1903)."

Cosey the Maine Coon was awarded a silver medal marked “National Cat Show, 1895,” with a cat face in the middle, a silver cat collar engraved “National Cat Show, 1895, won by Cosey,” and a picture of “Cosey” wearing a collar ribbon marked “National Cat Show.” 'Cosey' is recognition for being the earliest and most successful competitive examples of the Maine Coon breed in it’s earliest of development.

The majority of Coon Cat breeders assert that the breed emerged from the interbreeding of existing shorthaired domestic cats and longhaired breeds from abroad, possibly including Angora types introduced by New England sailors or longhaired cats brought to America by the Vikings."

That title went to archaic and totally extinct groups such as the creodonts – burly predators that superficially resembled the cats and hyenas that would come later – and mesonychids, nicknamed “wolves with hooves.” The miacids stayed small as long as these larger predators were on the prowl, but by about 42 million years ago the miacids sprouted off a new branch of their own. Other mammals – such as woolly rhinos and Himalayan blue sheep – seem to have gotten their start in the same place, leading paleontologists to suggest that mammals whoevolved in this chilly place developed adaptations for cooler conditions, which allowed them to spread outward and thrive as the planet started to go through the ebb and flow of Ice Ages. The naturalist Henri Filhol named this extinct beast back in 1879 from fossils found in France, and even then he could tell that the mammal had something to do with the origin of felines: Proailurus means “first cat.” Not that Proailurus looked very much like the cats we know today.

Experts generally agree that there are 37 species in the family Felidae, but they have offered dozens of classification schemes, ordering cat species in as few as two to as many as 23 genera. Elegant and enigmatic, cats tantalize not only those of us who share our sofas with the smaller versions but scientists who have tried to puzzle out the origin and evolution of their larger cousins.

      "tfidf_summary": "(Oddly, domestic cats seem to have reached the British Isles before the Romans brought them over—a dispersal that researchers cannot yet explain.) Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the globe, domestic cats had presumably spread to the Orient almost 2,000 years ago, along well-established trade routes between Greece and Rome and the Far East, reaching China by way of Mesopotamia and arriving in India via land and sea. The putative antiquity of these breeds received support from the results of genetic studies announced last year, in which Marilyn Menotti-Raymond of the National Cancer Institute and Leslie Lyons of the University of California, Davis, found DNA differences between today’s European and Oriental domestic cat breeds indicative of more than 700 years of independent cat breeding in Asia and Europe. In the genetic analysis, published in 2007, Driscoll, another of us (O’Brien) and their colleagues focused on two kinds of DNA that molecular biologists traditionally examine to differentiate subgroups of mammal species: DNA from mitochondria, which is inherited exclusively from the mother, and short, repetitive sequences of nuclear DNA known as microsatellites. Confounding the issue was the fact that members of these wildcat groups are hard to tell apart from one another and from feral domesticated cats with so-called mackerel-tabby coats because all of them have the same pelage pattern of curved stripes and they interbreed freely with one another, further blurring population boundaries. The reason for the relative lack of variability in cats is simple: humans have long bred dogs to assist with particular tasks, such as hunting or sled pulling, but cats, which lack any inclination for performing most tasks that would be useful to humans, experienced no such selective breeding pressures."

Sphynx kittens are born with a soft downy coat and are very wrinkly, when they mature they should retain their wrinkles, especially on the face and neck. They usually have some short soft hair on the bridge of their nose, muzzle, tail, ears and feet, they are very warm to the touch. The Sphynx cat although described as hairless, has a very short downy coat, which can often be hard to see or feel. Sphynx cats have very large ears and a muscular body with a broad chest, the face is broad with large lemon shaped eyes."

      "tfidf_summary": "Looking at the history of cats, it is extremely hard to pinpoint exactly when in they became domesticated, but evidence points to them being “commensal domesticates.” Like rats, mice, sparrows, and other animals that live in urbanized areas, it is likely that cats were drawn to human settlements, probably as a result of the other animals there. Weir admitted that he originally did not have any particular love for cats, but once experiencing their merits as pets, he became one of their biggest fans, claiming they were “an object of increasing interest, admiration, and cultured beauty.” The first cat show in 1871 was one of many. All cats in modern China, however, descend from the African Wildcat, suggesting that it is possible that this subspecies replaced the breeds of domesticated cats in China as a result of the opening of the Silk road trade route, and contact with civilizations in the Middle East, as well as with Rome. They feel after him and when they have found him they kiss him under the tail.” This hatred was taken up by the Church, who often accused heretical groups such as the Cathars as associating with and even worshipping cats. These pictures found their way into a broad spectrum of publications, reaching people from across the social strata of England at the time, and a number of annuals were published which became very popular as Christmas gifts."

      "tfidf_summary": "Instead, archaeologists rely on the size of animal bones found in archaeological sites (domesticated cats are smaller than feral cats), by their presence outside of their normal range, if they are given burials or have collars or the like, and if there is evidence that they have established a commensal relationship with the humans. As applied to different animal species, true commensals live entirely in houses with us, occasional commensals move between houses and outdoor habitats, and obligate commensals are those that can only survive in an area because of their ability to occupy houses. There are two difficulties inherent in determining when and how cats were domesticated: one is that domesticated cats can and do interbreed with their feral cousins; the other is that the primary indicator of cat domestication is their sociability or docility, traits not easily identified in the archaeological record. Species-based conservation of the Scottish wildcat has included removing them from the wild and placing them into zoos and wildlife sanctuaries for captive breeding, as well as the targeted destruction of feral domestic and hybrid cats in the wild. In 2014, Hu and colleagues reported evidence for early cat-human interactions during the Middle-Late Yangshao (early Neolithic, 7,000-5,000 cal BP) period at the site of Quanhucun, in Shaanxi province, China."

Domestic cats are carnivores, and a good diet for them consists of roughly 30 per cent to 35 percent muscular meat, 30 percent carbs, and 8 per cent to 10 per cent lipids, all of which stimulate growth and good skin and coat. The domestic cat, on the other hand, has weak colour vision and just two types of cone cells that are tuned for blue and yellowish green sensitivity; its ability to discern between red and green is restricted. These sense the breadth of gaps and the location of things in the dark, both by touching them directly and by sensing air currents; they also activate defensive blink reflexes to protect the eyes from harm. Because there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the cat and other wild mammals were most likely introduced to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland by the occupants of this Neolithic settlement."

Although cats seem to have enjoyed their ancient high standing in European countries at first (in Norse mythology , for example, the great goddess Freya is depicted in a chariot drawn by cats and in both Ireland and Scotland cats are depicted as magical in a positive sense) the Christian Church, following their regular course of demonizing important pagan symbols, drew on the pre-existing link between the cat and witchcraft to associate cats with evil as personified in the Devil. The Egyptians are also responsible for the very name `cat' in that it derives from the North African word for the animal, “quattah”, and, as the cat was so closely associated with Egypt, almost every other European nation employs variations on this word: French, chat ; Swedish, katt ; German, katze ; Italian, gatto ; Spanish, gato and so forth (Morris, 175). Godey of Philadelphia from 1830 -1878, this monthly periodical featured stories, articles, poems, and engravings and is perhaps best known for helping to institutionalize the practice of the family Christmas tree in America (although it also advocated for women's rights, education, the celebration of Thansgiving, and was among the first to publish Edgar Allen Poe's work). Cats first came to North America, it is thought, in 1749 CE, from England, to help control the mice and rat population but they seem to have been largely considered utilitarian until the Victorian Age when they became cherished pets and, in the United States, this was largely due to the influence of Godey's Lady's Book and Sarah Hale's contributions to it."

A story from ancient China tells how the gods originally gave cats control over the world and the power of speech so they could communicate clearly; but the cats were not at all interested in this job, preferring to sleep and play. Anyone who has ever lived with a cat will recognize how little they have changed over time and, as in the Chinese myth, still do whatever they please whenever they like."
