Ideas and plans

- don't get IP banned
- respect robots.txt file
    - find rules and parse then dynamically
- use https://commoncrawl.org/
    - they don't want you to ddos them. be nice to their servers
        - crawl their data (somewhat slowly) with a bot and store results in your own database server?
            - fetch database results to the frontend?

- implement AI agents to summarize and analyze data

```
    Research Agent (Agent 1): The first agent uses Firecrawl to search multiple web sources, extract relevant content, and generate an initial research report. Think of this agent as your data gatherer and initial synthesizer.

    Elaboration Agent (Agent 2): The second agent takes the baton, analyzing the initial report and transforming it into a more comprehensive document with additional context, examples, case studies, and implications. This agent acts as your content enhancer and expert editor.

    Coordination Process: OpenAI's Agents SDK manages the handoff between these specialized agents, ensuring that each focuses on its specific strengths, similar to how a research team might have different specialists for data collection and analysis.

‚úÖ Suggested Architecture (Performance-Optimized)
ü¶Ä Rust: Fast Concurrent Crawler

    Handles robots.txt

    Fetches raw HTML

    Concurrent with tokio or async-std

    Streams results to downstream processor (JSON or plain text)

üêç Python: LLM Summarizer Microservice

    Small API that takes raw text and returns a summary

    Runs locally with Ollama (llama2, mistral, etc.) or calls OpenAI

    Optionally writes to vector DB or JSONL archive

üí¨ Minimal Interface

    Optional CLI or terminal interface (no UI bloat)

    Simple prompt: ‚ÄúAsk about what I crawled‚Äù




    Common Crawl parser + summarizer pipeline
        - warc common crawler
        - rs-spider for live sites

    Lightweight vector DB + semantic search

    Optional chatbot interface for querying summaries
